# TemperatureConverter

I was doing coding projects in JS on CodeAcademy.com and KhanAcademy.org and one of the projects I was asked to make was a temperature converter. After successfully completing the project and getting a working model that converts a given temperature in Kelvin into other temperature units, I realized that I wasn't satisfied enough with my project. Yes, it was original and it worked and everything, but it takes Kelvin, a temperature unit that nobody even uses, and converts+displays it only in the console/terminal. It's great for personal use, for me the programmer, but it's effectively useless as a converter for the public!

As a result, I decide I was going take my project, stick it into VS.code and get back to work on it to satisfy myself. I taught myself HTML and CSS in the span of ~1 month and have effectively created a webpage that uses the JS script and receives user input in a more universally accepted unit of temperature (Celsius) and converts it into other units of temperature (i.e. Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Newton). I hope this program serves as an effective temperature converter for anyone in thermodynamics who needs quick temperature conversion or just anyone in general who wants effective temperature conversion.

Enjoy,
